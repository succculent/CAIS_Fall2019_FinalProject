# Sarcasm Classifier
For our final project for the Fall 2019 CAIS semester, our team built an sarcasm classifier. We found a kaggle dataset[1] of over 1 million sarcastic and non-sarcastic comments extracted from Reddit, we built a sarcasm classifier. For the classifier we used a keras 1D convolutional network. Our results were able to show over 74% accuracy in classification. These results can definitely be improved with network tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and different encoding methods.
